European Firearms Pass

(1) A European firearms pass is a public instrument authorising its holder, when travelling to other Member States, to take with him/her a firearm entered in the pass and ammunition for such firearm in the amount corresponding to the purpose of the use of the firearm, if the Member State to which or through which the holder is travelling has been granted authorisation to travel with such firearm. A specimen of the European firearms pass shall be set out in the implementing legal regulation.

(2) By the way of derogation from paragraph 1, a hunter may take with him/her one or more firearms laid down in Section 6 (a) and (b) or a marksman may take with him/her one or more firearms laid down in Section 5 (a) through (f) or in Section 6 (a) and (b) without any previous authorisation during his/her journey through two or more member States with a view to engaging in hunting or sporting activities, provided that they are in possession of an European firearms pass listing such firearm or firearms and provided that they can substantiate the reason for their journey, in particular by producing the invitation. However, this derogation shall not apply to journeys to a Member State which prohibits the acquisition and possession of firearms in question or which makes such subject to authorization; in such a case, an express statement to that effect shall be entered on the European firearms pass.

(3) A European firearms pass shall be issued by the relevant police unit to a natural person who has a place of residence in the Czech Republic and who is an authorised firearm holder. An application for a European firearms pass shall be filed on an official form, the specimen of which shall be set out in the implementing legal regulation and shall encompass the personal data of the applicant. Two photographs shall be submitted with the application.

(4) The European firearms pass shall be valid for five years and may be extended by the relevant police unit. If firearms of category D are recorded in the pass it shall be issued maximally for a period of ten years.

(5) The European firearms pass shall be terminated if

a) it expires;

b) its loss or theft is reported; or

c) its holder's firearm permit has been terminated or a decision on the withdrawal of the firearm permit comes into effect (Section 27).

(6) The relevant police unit shall decide on terminating the validity of a European firearms pass if

a) it is damaged so that records in it are illegible or it is flawed;

b) it contains unauthorised records;

c) it contains incorrect records.

If the holder of a European firearms pass recognises the reason for termination of the validity of his/her European firearms pass, a protocol thereof shall be made. The validity of the European firearms pass is terminated by such record.

(7) The holder of a European firearms pass the validity of which has been terminated pursuant to paragraph 5 or 6 shall be obliged to deliver it to the relevant police unit within ten days from the date of its termination. If the holder of a European firearms pass dies, identical procedure as that for the death of a holder of firearms or ammunition shall apply (Section 65).

(8) If the validity of a European firearms passis terminated under paragraph (5) (b) or paragraph 6 (a) or (c), the relevant police unit shall issue, after two photographs have been presented by an applicant for a European firearm pass a new European firearms passwithout any application, with the period of validity being the same as that of the original European firearms pass. If a European firearms passis issued as a replacement for a lost or stolen European firearms passit shall be clearly indicated that it is a duplicate.

(9) The relevant police unit shall retain or withdraw a European firearms pass if its holder's firearm permit is also retained or withdrawn.
