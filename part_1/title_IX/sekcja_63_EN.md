Deactivating and Destroying Firearms and Ammunition and Production of Cuts of Firearm and Ammunition

(1) A firearm of category A, B or C may be deactivated or destroyed or its cut may be made only upon an approval issued by the relevant police unit unless the cut is directly produced by a firearm manufacturer. In the case of a firearm which is designated as cultural heritage, approval for its deactivation or destruction or for the production of a cut shall also be issued by the State Office for Maintenance and Preservation of Cultural Heritage.

(2) Prior to deactivating, destroying or making a cut, the holder of a firearm or a prohibited accessory to a firearm referred to in paragraph 1 shall be obliged to submit to the relevant police unit such firearm for forensic criminal testing along with an application in writing filed on an official form, the specimen of which shall be set out in the implementing legal regulation. The application shall encompass the following:

a) personal data or data identifying a legal entity;

b) the reason for deactivation or destruction of a firearm, its main part or a prohibited accessory to a firearm or for making a cut; and

c) particulars of the firearm or data identifying a main part of the firearm or prohibited accessory to the firearm.

(3) The applicant shall be obliged to submit along with the application

(a) the firearm, the main part of the firearm or the prohibited accessory to the firearm; if their dimensions do not allow to do so he/she shall be obliged to provide information as to where such articles are kept;

b) a firearm certificate, if the firearm has been registered, or of a main part of a firearm; and

c) the written consent of a relevant authority of the State Office for Maintenance and Preservation of Cultural Heritage in the case of a firearm which is deemed to be cultural heritage.

The relevant police unit shall issue a certificate on taking over any of the articles stated above.

(4) The relevant police unit shall reject an application filed under paragraph 2 if there is after criminal forensic testing a reasonable suspicion that a criminal offence or a minor offence was committed by such firearm.

(5) The provisions of paragraphs 1 through 4 shall also apply to cases where repairs or modifications to a firearm irreversibly destroy or, for the purposes of ballistic testing, damage a main part of a firearm. The obligation imposed on the firearm holder by the provisions of paragraph (2) shall be transferred to any person who repairs or modifies such firearm.

(6) An applicant who has been issued approval under paragraph 1 shall be obliged within 20 working days from the date on which the approval was issued to hand over the firearm of category A, B or C for deactivation or destruction or for production of its cut to a person who is authorised to do such work. The applicant shall hand over to such person also ammunition if the applicant intends to deactivate or destroy it or if its cut is to be made. The person concerned shall issue to the applicant a certificate on taking over a firearm, a main part of a firearm, a prohibited accessory to a firearm or ammunition. If the applicant does not hand over the firearm of category A, B or C to be deactivated or destroyed or the cut of which is to be made under the first sentence he/she shall be obliged to return the approval within 20 working days from the last day of the original time limit to the relevant police unit.

(7) An applicant who has been issued approval under paragraph 1 shall be obliged within 10 working days from the deactivation or destruction of the firearm, main part of the firearm or a prohibited accessory to the firearm or after production of a cut, to deliver to the relevant police unit which issued the approval, a document produced by the respective authorised person certifying that such articles have been deactivated, destroyed or that the cut was made. In the case that a firearm, a main part of a firearm or a prohibited accessory to a firearm was deactivated or destroyed or a cut was made the applicant shall also submit the firearm, main part of the firearm or the prohibited accessory to the firearm to be checked; if their dimensions do not allow to do so he/she shall be obliged to provide information as to where such articles are kept.

(8) The holder of a deactivated firearm may not carry it visibly in public places or in places accessible to the general public. When carrying a deactivated firearm he/she shall be obliged to carry with him/her a certificate on its deactivation.
