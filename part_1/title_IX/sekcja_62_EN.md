If the conditions for securing firearms and ammunition are breached during the public display of firearms and ammunition the police unit which issued authorisation shall require the person authorised to amend the situation so that conditions are no longer breached. In case such requirement is not fulfilled or conditions are breached more than once the police unit which issued the authorisation shall withdraw it. The police unit shall forthwith inform the organiser of the display thereof. No appeal is permissible against a decision on withdrawing the authorisation.
