Termination of the Validity of a Firearm Permit

(1) The validity of a firearm licence shall terminate if

a) a decision on withdrawal of the firearm licence has come into effect (Section 36);

b) its loss or theft has been reported;

c) the legal person has been wound up;

d) the natural or legal person has ceased the activities for which the firearm licence was issued; or

e) the holder of the firearm licence passed away or has been declared dead.

(2) The relevant police unit shall decide on terminating the validity of the firearm licence if

a) it is damaged so that records in it are illegible or it is flawed;

b) it contains unauthorised records; or

c) it contains incorrect records.

If the holder of a firearm licence recognises the reason for termination of the validity of his/her firearm licence, a protocol thereof shall be made. The validity of the firearm licence is terminated by such record.

(3) A holder shall be obliged to render a firearm licence invalidated under paragraph 1 (a) (c) or (d) within ten working days from the date on which the firearm licence was terminated to the relevant police unit. A firearm licence invalidated under paragraph 1 (e) shall be delivered to the police by the person who found it.

(4) If the validity of a firearm licence is terminated under paragraph (1) (b) or paragraph (2), the relevant police unit shall issue a new firearm licence without any application with the period of validity being the same as that of the original firearm licence. If a firearm licence is issued as a replacement for a lost or stolen firearm licence it shall be clearly indicated that it is a duplicate.
