Termination of the Validity of a Firearm Permit

(1) The validity of a firearm permit shall terminate if

a) the period for which it was issued expires;

b) its loss or theft is reported;

c) a decision on withdrawal of a firearm permit comes into effect (Section 27); or

d) the holder of a firearm permit has passed away or is declared to be dead.

(2) The relevant police unit shall decide on terminating the validity of a firearm permit if

a) it is damaged such that records in it are illegible or it is flawed;

b) it contains unauthorised records;

c) it contains incorrect records; or

d) its holder terminated his/her residence in the Czech Republic.

If the holder of a firearm permit recognises the reason for termination of the validity of his/her firearm permit, a protocol thereof shall be made. The validity of a firearm permit shall be terminated by such record.

(3) If the validity of a firearm permit is terminated under paragraph (1) (b) or paragraph (2) (a) or (c), the relevant police unit shall issue, after two photographs are presented by permit holder, a new firearm permit without any application, with the period of validity being the same as that of the original firearm permit. If a firearm permit is issued as a replacement for a lost or stolen firearm permit it shall be clearly indicated that it is a duplicate.
